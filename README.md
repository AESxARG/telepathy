# GAME 001: Telepathy : Exploring Time + Symmetry

An exploratory protocol for quantifying the structural dynamics of communication. By modeling interactions as geometric lattices, the system measures the stability and symmetry of agent-to-agent feedback loops.

## Mechanics

  1. **Vectorization (Input)**<br>
    Agent interactions are quantized into 4D spacetime vectors ($v$) representing the observed properties:
      * $\Delta t$ (Temporal Span): The duration and frequency of the session.
      * $\mu$ (Payload Mass): The information density.
      * $\rho$ (Reciprocity): The symmetry of exchange between agents.
      * $\delta$ (Drift): The angular deviation from perfect alignment.
  2. **Geometric Classification (State)**<br>
    The system calculates internal angles ($\alpha, \beta, \gamma$) to identify a geometry based on the interactions:
      * Triclinic: ($\alpha \neq \beta \neq \gamma$) – Low symmetry match
      * Orthorhombic: ($\alpha = \beta = \gamma = 90^\circ$) – Stable symmetry match
      * Hexagonal: ($\gamma = 120^\circ$) – High symmetry match
  3. **Subjective Time (Output)**<br>
    A Subjective Time Factor ($D$) is generated, representing the subjective compression of time during high-density interaction events.

## Analysis Topology (`runDemo`)

  * Low Sync: Low-symmetry interactions between two agents.
  * High Sync: High-symmetry interactions between two agents.
  * Triad Sync: Example of interactions between three agents.
